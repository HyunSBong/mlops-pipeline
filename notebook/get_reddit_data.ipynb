How does Target compete against that? The primary thing is likely they have to compete on price, which is not great. Tariffs will be another issue.

It feels like the kind of thing where okay news could - at least temporarily - cause a nice rally. Any sort of improvement in the tariff situation could cause a rally.

The market has bad days, weeks, months and it\\'s never fun by any means but it becomes if someone is very stressed by all this, then they have to make some changes in their portfolio (too much risk and/or too much money in the market.)  To me, this sort of situation where names are increasingly oversold, stuff down 20-30%+ in a month, sentiment horrible on a historic level is when you want to not be overly stressed by the market and instead look around and *gradually* start buying at least a bit of what everyone else is throwing out.',\n",

You are 100% in a massively overvalued market and 0% in companies with competitive valuations. You are 100% in companies that are extremely vulnerable to geopolitical events and recessions and 0% in companies that fare well in that environment. You are 100% in established companies that may well be past their prime and 0% in new opportunities. \\n\\nThe other person is right - there's no inherent reason to sell at a loss unless your thesis has changed. It's just that this should never have been your portfolio in the first place unless you have an insane level of confidence in US Tech. Also, it's highly questionable how you can possibly be optimistic about all of these companies or even know much about them - I'm willing to bet anything you don't have a strong understanding of most of them. \\n\\nI would do a few things:\\n\\n1. Figure out which companies you actually understand and are confident in. \\n\\n2. Find two BM ETFs: one Europe, one Int'l, and at bare minimum stick 25% (but realistically more) into those even if you're utterly confident that the US will reach new heights in the very near future. \\n\\n3. Consider selling anything you bought because you saw it on wallstreetbets or on YouTube, which is what a lot of this looks like, or at least thoroughly research the company. \\n\\n4. It's tempting to keep what's in the red, but it has no bearing on future performance. Hold or don't, but be aware of your own bias and understand that there is zero relationship between a stock being down and future performance. Sometimes they come back, other times they're red for a reason and don't come back, or if they do your money is still better put elsewhere. \\n\\nMy PERSONAL sell list, and this is pure opinion because there are arguments either way, would definitely include: GOOG, TSLA, PYPL, META, and SOFI. I would personally consider keeping JPM, NIO, and AMD. Again, this is personal opinion, take it as such. I would also go way more than 25% int'l, but one can make a reasonable argument for anywhere between 25% and 100% non-US, so my previous rec was conservative because if in doubt it's better to stay closer to the status quo.\",\n",

The US market is massively overvalued, to say nothing of the current chaos. You also have a lot of overlap, I assume unintentionally, that overexposes you to certain stocks.

The credit rating business is heavily oligopolistic and they generally can increase prices above the rate of inflation while keeping their costs down, leading to incremental increases in margins over the years.\\n\\nSPGI is a little bit more diversified than MCO and they have another great business. This is their indices business, which is highly profitable. \\n\\nI’m sure you’ve heard of the S&P500 and Dow Jones. SPGI owns and manages these and many more indexes. Then they both have their data and analytics business which is okay. MCO is more of a pure play on credit.\\n\\nFICO is much the same, except their focus is on individual people’s credit, as opposed to companies and countries credit.\\n\\nAll three of them are great businesses.

Most were overvalued before the recent crash. Some still are. But i haven't bought them at the overvalued prices.

And no, the 1/1/1 portfolio is a standard recommendation for set and forget investors, investing internationally is not new, except maybe to people who have never consulted any source except reddit. \\n\\nJust ask yourself some common sense questions:\\n\\n1. Assuming it\\'s 2045 and you have no idea what market conditions are like, do you think it\\'s smart to put 100% of your money in one country and 0% in the rest of the world? If so, why? \\n\\n2. Looking at the short/medium term, the US is highly overvalued, currently in the 98th percentile. When you do the math, it\\'s more expensive to buy 80% of the US than it is to buy every other company in the world combined. Some of your individual picks drag you into even more extreme territory? Does that sound like a good deal to you? Why or why not? \\n\\n3. Why did you ask for advice on this thread only to react negatively upon receiving the feedback you were presumably seeking. Could you make a thorough argument as to why 100% US is a good strategy, and if so, what is that argument? Would you be confident recommending this allocation to a friend or family member? If you were hiring someone to invest your money, would you hire yourself based on that reaction? If not, who would you hire?\\n\\n4. Your portfolio is heavily concentrated not just geographically, but also (albeit to a lesser degree) by sector. What justifies that allocation?  \\n\\n5. Your past investments are not relevant. The fact that you got RR at X price will never help or hurt you at any point in the future. Why did you mention it? Are you confident that this wasn\\'t an emotional reaction? \\n\\nUnfortunately \"I\\'m right and everything else is temporary noise\" is not a rational argument. You either have strong reasons to maintain this portfolio or you do not. That was true a year ago and will be a year from today. Your money is yours to lose and you are not obligated to invest rationally, but very simply it is extremely difficult to see the rationale for this portfolio even discounting the individual companies and any medium-term trends. \\n\\nTake a couple of days and put your rationale into writing - geographical allocation, responses to 5-10 year trends, sector allocation, each individual stock etc. Write the strongest possible counterargument to your own justifications, and adjust where you feel your reasoning is weak. If you\\'re going to lose money, it\\'s far better to do so with a strong thesis than it is to lose your life savings because you were too proud and wanted to prove to some stranger on the internet that, apparently, international investing is a week-old idea, the south will rise again, and hell will freeze over any day now.',\n",

Sometimes, holding is fine if you’re not losing much.\\n\\n# If This is a Roth IRA (Highly Recommend If You Don’t Already Have One):\\n\\n* You can sell and rebalance your investments inside a Roth IRA without any tax consequences. That’s the beauty of a Roth – your money grows tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.\\n* At your age (21), starting a Roth IRA is a solid move because you have decades for that money to compound tax-free.\\n\\n# What I’d Recommend:\\n\\n* **If you’re not sure whether this is a Roth or taxable, check your account type in the app.**\\n* **If it’s taxable:** You can sell and consolidate, but be mindful of gains.\\n* **If it’s a Roth:** You’re free to sell and rebalance without tax worries.\\n* Going forward, keep it simple – one or two U.S. stock ETFs, one international, and maybe a small-cap or bond fund if you want.\\n* Since you’re young, it’s a great time to focus on long-term growth.

Of course they were always going to raise prices. A 30% tariff is still REALLY bad. It’s not embargo like 145% but still very very bad for American consumers. On top of that, Trump got nothing from China for his capitulation on this. American goods going into China are now tariffed at 10%, before this it was 0. Even with 125% China was giving exemptions to businesses left and right because they weren’t really all that into self harm, like Trump. \\n\\nThe thing is for businesses not as big as Wally world it’s going to be a really shitty summer. Store shelves will be empty. Prices will be much higher… even at Wally world per their own statements. Wally world will likely have stuff on shelves that smaller stores won’t so guess what… more consolidation is coming… more mid and small businesses are going to go away because they couldn’t get stuff with the embargo level tariffs on. With the delays in shipping and lead times that means July and August are going to be the real trough. That’s when things will be hardest on the American consumer. Just in time for back to school… but don’t worry… unemployment will be higher too… it’s already starting in the ports and truckers. They’re seeing less work due to ship sailings being cancelled and those coming in are lighter than normal. Every 4 containers is a job, simple thumb rule. Then it’ll spread to the retailers. This summer is going to be brutal for mom and pop shops and even middle size companies. The big boyz like Wally world, Amazon, Costco, etc will likely do fine… but you’re gonna pay more.

Someone has to pay, simple math. \\n\\nFrom history we know that inflation is delayed, sometimes up to a year (COVID shutdowns and stimulus payments only caused inflation in early 2021, even though were implemented by Trump administration beginning spring 2020), but once it arrives, it is VERY hard to get rid of, because it becomes an expectation and employees demand higher wages, which leads back to higher prices, which leads back to higher wages, etc etc.\\n\\nSecond stage comes when higher prices suppress demand (this is very different from 2021 when it was higher demand that caused higher prices in the first place!), and lead to further drop in profits and lay off of workers. Granted, that may help to subdue the inflation, but by then we will be in a recession. Could last another 2-3 years beginning from 2026.',\n",

If the import/wholesale cost of an item was $10 before the tariffs and a retailer sold it for $15, that would be a 33% margin. Now after a 30% tariff, the import cost of the item will be $13. In order to maintain that 33% margin, the new price will be $19.50. So the tariff tax is $3, but the increased cost to the consumer is $6.50.',\n",

       " {'title': 'No way Musk gets $50B. In my Aussie MBA, the US’s 300:1 pay ratio is taught as the most extreme example of inequality and company governance',\n",
       "  'selftext': \"One reason is the CEO PAY RATIO, and the other reason is corporate governance. Tesla's management is mostly Musk's cronies, and it has lost its public nature. I had a serious discussion with many Tesla fans on Twitter Space in 2023. They think I am a stupid European old continent style professional manager. What public nature, what small and medium shareholders' interests. The great Musk leads Tesla to one milestone after another, which is a victory. Selling so many Tesla cars is a victory, and launching rockets again and again is a victory, why not pay salaries. A person with only a few hundred shares actually sued a key figure who made the United States great, and it was approved. This is a joke.\\n\\nI mentioned the CEO PAY RATIO and the responsibility and morality of enterprises to society, which attracted more Tesla fans, including typical investors on Reddit who think that there is no European old continent in the United States, including the stupid morality of the old world like Australia, which is a joke. In the United States, only whoever makes money is the most powerful. No need to reason, just show the holdings, full of social Darwinism theory, if you believe in Tesla, buy CALL, if you don't believe, buy PUT, why discuss science, why discuss technology and implementation routes, no need, these are all jokes. And there is no scientific spirit, just shout orders.\\n\\nBut in fact, when I think back to 2017, when I was attending an MBA course at a very small school in Australia, the teacher talked about the concept of CEO Pay Ratio, saying that American companies are as high as 300:1. That is, the gap between grassroots employees and CEOs is 300 times. And the UK, a bad country in Europe, is only 70-100 times. I knew that this salary would not satisfy Musk. Because if Musk's salary is really approved, it will bring the US Pay Ratio to an incredible level. The United States has completely lost any morality.\\n\\nAlthough the United States is indeed a country where everything is about money and whoever has money is the king, I also see that the strong Delaware judges are trying to maintain the final decency of the judiciary to give social fairness.\\n\\nCompared to the SEC, which weakly sued Musk and was even broken by Musk, the Delaware judge is the last and best shield of the United States.\\n\\nThe SEC is a regulatory unit that lacks even the most basic dignity and is far weaker than China's Securities Regulatory Commission.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '> Coinbase on Thursday reported that cyber criminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data to use in social engineering attacks. The incident may cost Coinbase up to $400 million to fix, the company estimated. The crypto exchange operator received an email on May 11 from someone claiming they obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts as well as other internal Coinbase documentation, including materials relating to customer-service and account-management systems, Coinbase reported in an SEC filing. Although passwords and private keys were not compromised, affected data included sensitive data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and emails; masked bank account numbers and identifiers as well as the last four digits of social security numbers; government ID images and account balances, the company said.\\n\\n> “Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks,” the company said in a blog post. “These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers. No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched. We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker.” Coinbase had detected the breach independently in previous months, per the filing. It immediately terminated the employees involved, warned customers whose information may have been accessed and enhanced its fraud monitoring protections.\\n\\n> The threat actor paid overseas contractors and employees in support rolls to obtain the information, it said. “We’re cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received,” the company said in the blog. “Instead we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.” Coinbase operates the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. In that past week it announced an acquisition that is expected to help it expand its global reach and gained entry to the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which will take effect next week.\\n\\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-hackers-bribed-staff-to-steal-customer-data-and-are-demanding-20-million-ransom.html',\n",
